# An Advanced Example

An example is provided to give an idea of how to get statistical only results, and how to get results with 1-systematics case.

In this example, we will use a simulated dataset for the Higgs boson decay to two tau leptons. 
We are using 

6 systematic uncertainties are parametrised by nuisance parameters corresponding to 
the Tau Energy Scale (TES), the Jet Energy Scale (JES), the soft missing energy component (SOFT_MET), the total background scale (BKG_SCALE), 
the smaller magnitude backgrounds ttbar (TTBAR_SCALE) and diboson (DIBOSON_SCALE). 
The default (no bias) values of these NP is 1., except for SOFT_MET for which it is 0.
